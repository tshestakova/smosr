\title{Plot temporal series of BEC-SMOS soil moisture data}
\usage{
plot_temporal_smos(data, freq = NULL, orbit = NULL, dates = NULL, QA = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.matrix as produced by \code{list_smos()} containing soil
moisture data to plot.}

\item{freq}{an integer specifying temporal frequency of the data. Possible
values are: 1 - for daily data, 3 - for 3-day moving averages, and NULL -
for cases when data frequency is irrelevant. Default value is \code{NULL}.}

\item{orbit}{a character (or character string) specifying SMOS orbit
corresponding to the data. Possible values are: ‘a’, ‘asc’, and ‘ascending’ -
for an ascending pass, or ‘d’, ‘des’, or ‘descending’ - for a descending
pass, and NULL - for cases when orbit is irrelevant. Default value is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{dates}{a object of class \code{Date} or a character string formatted
as ‘yyyy-mm-dd’ (e.g. ‘2010-06-01’) which specifies the dates to plot the
data for.}

\item{QA}{a numeric vector specifying the desired quality assurance of the
data to be plotted. Possible values range from 0 (good quality data) to 15.
To know the meanings of QA > 0, please refer to the technical note on the
BEC-SMOS soil moisture products available at

\description{
This function plots temporal series of BEC-SMOS soil moisture data
extracted for specific geographical locations using \code{extract_smos()}.
}
\details{
Note that the data characterized by the same frequency and SMOS orbit can
be drawn at a time. If the dataset to plot contains a mixture of temporal
resolution and/or SMOS passes, arguments \code{frequency} and \code{orbit}
must be specified.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# to plot extracted temporal series of soil moisture data
# with the specified frequency, SMOS orbit and QA
smos_data <- list_smos()
lat <- c(40.42, 41.90, 48.86, 52.50, 59.91)
lon <- c(-3.70, 12.50, 2.35, 13.40, 10.75)
sm_estimates <- extract_smos(data = smos_data, lat = lat, lon = lon)
plot_temporal_smos(data = sm_estimates, freq = 3, orbit = "d", QA = 0)
