Description: Provides functions that automate accessing, downloading and exploring Soil Moisture
    and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 4 (L4) data developed by Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). 
    Particularly, it includes functions to search for, acquire, extract, and plot BEC-SMOS L4 soil 
    moisture data downscaled to ~1 km spatial resolution. Note that SMOS is one of Earth Explorer 
    Opportunity missions by the European Space Agency (ESA). More information about SMOS  
    products can be found at <https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/smos/data>.
