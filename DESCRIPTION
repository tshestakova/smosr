Description: Provides functions that automate accessing, downloading and exploring ESA-BEC
    Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data into R. Particularly, it includes functions to 
    search for, acquire, extract, and plot BEC-SMOS L4 soil moisture data downscaled to ~1 km 
    spatial resolution (EASE-grid v.2).
