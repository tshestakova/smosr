# smosr

Acquire and Explore BEC-SMOS L4 Soil Moisture Data in R

## Overview

The goal of `smosr` is to automate accessing, downloading and exploring Soil 
Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 4 (L4) data developed by Barcelona 
Expert Center (BEC). Particularly, it includes functions to search for, acquire, 
extract, and plot BEC-SMOS L4 soil moisture data downscaled to ~1 km spatial 
resolution. 

## Installation

Install the released version of `smosr` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("smosr")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use the newest features of the package, install the
development version of `smosr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tshestakova/smosr")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(smosr)

# # to set credentials for accessing the BEC server
# # note that "username" and "password" should be replaced with your login details 
# set_credentials("username", "password")

# to search for BEC-SMOS data with the specified parameters available on the server
start_date <- as.Date("2010-07-15")
end_date <- as.Date("2022-07-15")
date_range <- seq(start_date, end_date, by = 365)
smos_data <- find_smos(freq = 3, orbit = "des", dates = date_range)

# to download the data from the server to a temporary directory in a local computer
download_smos(data = smos_data)

# to list all BEC-SMOS data files currently stored in the temporary directory
smos_files <- list_smos()
head(smos_files, 5)

# to extract soil moisture estimates for the specified geographical locations
# from the list of data files obtained in the previous steps
lat <- c(38.72, 41.90, 48.86, 52.50, 59.44)
lon <- c(-9.14, 12.50, 2.35, 13.40, 24.75)
sm_estimates <- extract_smos(data = smos_files, lat = lat, lon = lon)

head(sm_estimates, 12)

# to plot extracted temporal series of soil moisture data
plot_temporal_smos(data = sm_estimates)
```

```{r}
# to draw a raster image of soil moisture estimates from a file with
# desired data quality and within the specified geographical bounds
lat <- c(35.00, 45.00)
lon <- c(-10.50, 4.50)
plot_raster_smos(data = smos_files[13], lat = lat, lon = lon, QA = c(0,1,2,3))
```
